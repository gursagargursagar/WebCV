**Where to start:** the repository is public and `v0.6.0` is tagged, with a
released image. What remains is the open backlog in
[PROJECT-REVIEW.md](PROJECT-REVIEW.md) and the remaining-work ledger in
[HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md#remaining-work-16-october-2026-pushed-as-c67c3bf).

> The paragraphs below are kept as written in August, when the repository was
> still private and the demo did not exist.

The product itself is further along than the phase numbers suggest: a person can
sign in, build a page from blocks, choose images from their library, connect a
mail server without touching a config file, test it, preview the result and
publish it — all verified in a browser, end to end.

This supersedes an earlier note here that said to start with blocks on the
grounds that the primitives "need blocks to have somewhere to live". That has it
backwards: primitives are what blocks compose _from_. Build blocks first and
they get written against raw Tailwind, then rewritten once the primitives land —
exactly the build-it-twice this plan warns about elsewhere. The existing
sections in `src/components` are a perfectly good proving ground for `Band`,
`Grid`, `Prose` and the rest, and they need the tokens that now exist.

The publish-time contrast gate is smaller still and `checkContrast` is ready, so
it is a reasonable warm-up.

**What works today:** a stranger can deploy this, claim it, answer four
questions and have a live portfolio they can edit without touching code. An
enquiry now emails them, and a forgotten passphrase is recoverable.

**What does not:** no blog, no themes beyond the one, no block builder, the
admin is the old component kit, and email covers only transactional SMTP —
no alternate providers, no integrations registry or secrets vault, no OTP.

**Fixed:** `/admin/welcome`'s Skip link used to be inert — it navigated without
setting `fullName`, so `AdminLayout`'s guard bounced straight back to it, on the
first screen every new deployer meets. Skipping and finishing now both record
the choice in `localStorage` (`app/admin/(protected)/_components/welcome-dismissed.ts`), and the guard
honours it. Inferring "never set up" from the content is right for deciding
whether to _offer_ the wizard and wrong for deciding whether to _force_ it.
Verified in a browser against a clean instance.

## Finishing locally, before any cloud account

Almost all of the remaining work can be built and genuinely verified on one
machine with Docker. That is worth knowing before paying for anything: the list
of things that truly need a hosted service is short, and none of them block
development.

### What Docker covers

| Remaining work                                | Local equivalent                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 2 primitives, ESLint bans, publish gate | Nothing external needed                                                     |
| Phase 5 blocks, pages, `draftMode()` preview  | Nothing external needed                                                     |
| Phase 7 admin: MediaPicker, builder polish    | Nothing external needed                                                     |
| Phase 9 launch checklist                      | Nothing external needed                                                     |
| Postgres / Supabase / Neon **database** half  | `postgres:16` — already wired; with Mailpit takes the suite from 655 to 751 |
| Supabase **Storage** half                     | `supabase start` runs the real `storage-api` container                      |
| Email send path                               | `axllent/mailpit` — already wired                                           |
| PocketBase, Appwrite adapters                 | Both ship official Docker images                                            |
| Cloudflare D1 + R2 adapter                    | `wrangler dev --local` (Miniflare) emulates both                            |
| Firebase adapter                              | The Firebase Emulator Suite                                                 |
| Convex adapter                                | `convex dev` runs a local backend                                           |
| Turnstile (spam)                              | Cloudflare publishes always-pass and always-fail test keys                  |
| Umami (analytics)                             | Self-hosts in Docker                                                        |

**All five missing storage adapters can be written and conformance-tested
without a single account.** That was not obvious and it changes the ordering:
Phase 8's adapters are gated on installing five emulators, not on signing up for
five services. HANDOVER.md counts them as "something this machine does not
have", which is true of any machine that has not installed them yet — it is a
setup cost, not a dependency on anybody's cloud.

### What genuinely needs the cloud

Four things, and only four:

1. **Vercel Blob.** Proprietary, no emulator. It is also what the Deploy button
   provisions, so it is the highest-priority cloud check.
2. **Real SMTP deliverability.** Mailpit accepts everything; a real provider
   enforces SPF, DKIM and rate limits.
3. **The Deploy button itself** — Vercel Marketplace auto-provisioning, and the
   claim flow on a genuinely public URL with `OPB_SETUP_TOKEN` set.
4. **Deployed-URL measurements** — Lighthouse budgets, securityheaders.com and
   Mozilla Observatory.

### Suggested order

1. ~~**Phase 2 remainder**~~ — the publish-time contrast gate shipped, and so
   did the primitives. **Tailwind 4 was re-evaluated 2026-10-18** (issue #9,
   PR #7 stays closed): the CSS-build guard landed and the full port is
   verified on the `tailwind4-attempt` branch. What is left is the product
   call — v4 requires Safari 16.4+, which decides who can see a site built
   with this. See the locked decisions.
2. ~~**Phase 5 blocks and pages**~~ — done. Blocks, pages, routing, preview and
   revisions all shipped; the record-per-row storage split moved to Phase 9.
3. ~~**Phase 7 `MediaPicker`**~~ — done. The shadcn rebuild is cancelled; see
   Phase 7 for why, and for what is left in it.
4. **Phase 8 adapters** — five files, each against its own local emulator.
5. **Phase 8 integrations registry + vault** — now with two real consumers
   (SMTP and Turnstile) to design the abstraction against, rather than none.
6. ~~**Phase 9 writing, themes, presets, newsletter, docs**~~ — done, including
   the marketing site, the help centre, the developer docs and an interactive
   demo. What is left of the phase is the launch checklist, and deploying any
   of it.
7. **Only then:** one cloud pass covering all four items above at once.

## Context

`d:\Projects\Open Portfolio Builder` began as one person's personal portfolio with a browser-only CMS bolted on. The goal is to turn it into a launchable open-source product that students, designers, developers, photographers, writers and others can deploy themselves, on free tiers, and run entirely from an admin UI with no developer help.

**The current architecture cannot deliver that**, and the reasons are structural, not cosmetic:

- Content lives in the _editor's own browser_ (IndexedDB). Visitors see whatever seed data was compiled into the JS bundle. **Clicking Publish changes nothing for visitors.**
- `submitContactMessage` ([cmsService.ts:421](../src/cms/services/cmsService.ts#L421)) writes enquiries to the _visitor's_ IndexedDB. The owner never receives a message. The form has always been a no-op.
- `VITE_ADMIN_PASSCODE` is compiled into the public bundle in plaintext; the session is an unsigned `{expiresAt}` in localStorage ([cmsService.ts:643-685](../src/cms/services/cmsService.ts#L643-L685)) that anyone forges in one console line. The only guard is a client-side redirect ([AdminLayout.tsx:34-36](../src/admin/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx#L34-L36)).
- No server ⇒ no email, no OTP, no secret-keeping. `SEOSettings` is fully editable and **read by nothing**; every route serves one hardcoded `<title>`. No OG unfurls, near-zero crawlability.
- `uploadMedia` ([cmsService.ts:482](../src/cms/services/cmsService.ts#L482)) stores raw `File` objects with no size cap, no byte sniffing, and classifies SVG as first-class — stored XSS the moment a server exists.
- 102 occurrences of the owner's name across 17 files; `public/` holds a personal résumé, two personal photos, 4 client screenshots and **10 third-party trademarked client logos** (Bank Asia, Apex, Mumuso…) that cannot legally ship in an MIT template.
- No LICENSE, no tests, no CI, no ESLint config (`npm run lint` is a broken script — eslint isn't even a dependency), no error boundaries, no 404 page.

**Outcome:** a Next.js application where content lives in a backend the user picks, the admin is genuinely secure, every page is crawlable and shareable, and a non-technical person goes from a Deploy button to a personalised live site without seeing an API key.

### The load-bearing idea: two read paths

> **STATUS — both paths exist.** The public snapshot path is built and proven.
> The authoring path is built too: the contract carries a `records` surface
> (`list/get/put/remove/collections` with per-record revisions and offset
> cursors, plus `getSingleton/putSingleton`) on all eight backends, covered by
> a conformance section (CRUD, conditional-write races, pagination, address
> validation, snapshot isolation). What _reads_ through it — the blog — does
> not exist yet, and that is the correct order: the access patterns that
> justify the surface arrive with the reader, not before it.

- **Authoring path — normalised records.** Admin reads/writes one record at a time with pagination and optimistic concurrency (`revision`). Makes a 400-post blog and per-record autosave possible.
- **Public path — one denormalised snapshot.** Publish rebuilds a single JSON blob under one key. Every public render is **one** adapter read, identical on all 8 backends, trivially cacheable. Snapshot excludes full post bodies (posts paginate separately) so it stays bounded.

### Adapter contract (`/adapters/contract.ts`)

Key departures from today's `ContentStore`:

- **Media returns a URL, never a Blob.** `getMedia(): Promise<Blob>` ([storage/types.ts:28](../src/cms/services/storage/types.ts#L28)) forces `hydrateMediaBlobs()` to download _every_ asset at boot. Replaced by `resolveUrl(key) → string`. The `idb:` protocol and the whole object-URL registry ([mediaUrls.ts](../src/cms/utils/mediaUrls.ts)) are deleted.
- **Adapters declare `capabilities`** (`durable`, `auth`, `fileStorage`, `fullTextSearch`, `realtime`, `transactions`, `listQueries`). Admin screens **hide** unsupported features rather than breaking.
- **Adapter config lives in env vars only, never in the database** — config is what tells you how to reach the database. Resolves the chicken-and-egg completely.
- Surfaces: `readSnapshot/writeSnapshot`, `list/get/put/remove/bulkPut`, `getSingleton/putSingleton`, `media`, `kv` (sessions/OTP/rate-limits/locks — deliberately _not_ content, so auth state is never exportable), optional `auth`, optional `transaction`.
  **As built, the contract has:** `readSnapshot/writeSnapshot`, `readOwner/writeOwner`, `media`, `messages`, `kv`, `health`, `provision`. The per-record and singleton surfaces were never written; `auth` and `transaction` were not needed, because sessions are minted in one place for every backend.

**Eight public adapter IDs, three engines.** Supabase/Neon/Cloudflare/PocketBase share `_shared/sql` (Drizzle, 3 dialects); Cloudflare-R2/Supabase-Storage/Appwrite share `_shared/s3`; Firebase, Convex and Local are bespoke. Each still exports its own id, display name, docs URL and capabilities, so the user-facing promise holds without eight divergent codebases.

**Every adapter must pass `/adapters/_conformance/suite.ts`** (~60 assertions: round-trip, slug uniqueness, revision conflict, cursor stability, snapshot etag, upload→resolveUrl→remove, kv TTL). No green run, no ship. _This is what makes eight adapters survivable._

**`local` vs demo.** IndexedDB cannot be a server adapter. Split honestly: `local` = JSON + files under `.opb/` (real server adapter, default for `npm run dev` and VPS/Docker; the registry refuses it in production on ephemeral hosts). `demo-idb` = client-only, behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPB_DEMO=1`, for the public demo site only.

### Auth

Adapter auth is an identity **verifier**, never the session mechanism — so all 8 backends share one session model and one `requireOwner()`.

- **Passkey (WebAuthn) registered at claim time** is the primary factor. No email provider, no DNS, no deliverability, phishing-resistant. Email OTP is recovery once mail is configured; a recovery passphrase (Argon2id) is the last resort. `/admin/login` only offers methods actually available on this instance.
- Session = opaque 256-bit token in an `httpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` cookie; stored server-side as `session:<sha256(token)>` so a DB leak is not a session leak. 30-day sliding / 90-day absolute. Not a JWT — instant revocation, identical on every backend.
- **Claim flow:** `OPB_SETUP_TOKEN` (auto-generated by the Deploy template) → else a 15-minute boot window with a one-time code written to the platform's function log (visible only to the deployer). Claim is atomic under a `kv` lock re-checking `owners.count === 0`. After claim, `/setup` is permanently 404.

### Five mechanisms so an unprotected `/admin` is impossible

1. `app/admin/(protected)/layout.tsx` calls `await requireOwner()` — a new page inside the group is guarded by existence.
2. **Every** server action and route handler calls `requireOwner()` independently. Server Actions are publicly-callable HTTP endpoints; layout guards do not protect them. _This is the most common App Router security mistake._
3. **CI AST guard**: `tests/guarded-actions.test.ts` walks `app/admin/_actions/**` and `app/api/{admin,media,preview,revalidate}/**` and fails the build on any exported async function that doesn't call `requireOwner` (or isn't in an explicit allowlist).
4. `instrumentation.ts` refuses to serve in production when `OPB_SESSION_SECRET` is missing or the resolved adapter is `local` on an ephemeral platform.
5. Middleware adds `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` and redirects sessionless requests — **UX and defence-in-depth only, explicitly not the authorization boundary.**

### Content model

**Typed collections + blocks as views over them.** Not "everything is a block": records need URLs, per-record SEO, RSS membership, tags, sort, filter and cross-references; a block is a _placement_. Arrangement stays free because `collection`, `featureItem`, `timeline`, `logoWall`, `testimonials` and `skills` are views with `source`/`filter`/`layout` props. Two sentences the user must learn: **your stuff lives in collections; your pages arrange it.**

**Blocks:** versioned per-block envelope (`{id, type, v, props, frame, hidden, anchor, role}`). `frame` is the _entire_ presentation vocabulary — `width`/`spacing`/`surface`/`divider`/`align`/`flip`, **enums only, no px, no colours**. There is no path from the UI to "20px purple Comic Sans". ~29 block types across identity, work, credentials, conversion, utility. Unknown types are quarantined and round-tripped, never dropped.

**Twelve mechanisms keep non-designer arrangements safe** — no free-form styling; **no nested layout containers** (the #1 source of four-column text on a phone); intrinsic `auto-fit minmax()` grids so `columns: 4` means _at most_ 4; `clamp()` type only; automatic heading hierarchy via context; alt text required at the picker; contrast guaranteed at the token layer; live content-length checks; overflow detection in the preview; prose clamped to `--measure`; and a **kitchen-sink CI matrix** — every block × every variant × 6 themes × light/dark × 390/768/1440, through axe-core. _Adding a block without adding it to the kitchen sink fails CI._

**Blocks × themes contract:** blocks own semantics, themes own tokens, neither imports the other. Blocks may only compose from ~17 closed primitives (`Band`, `Measure`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Prose`, `Card`, `Media`, `Button`…), enforced by ESLint bans on colour/size utilities and arbitrary values inside `core/blocks/**` and `themes/**`. **A theme that ships only tokens is a complete theme.** There is deliberately no per-block override hook — that is the crack the whole contract leaks through.

**Tokens:** primitive → semantic → component, ~95 tokens generated from ~10 author-facing inputs (brand colour, neutral temperature, radius, density, type scale, fonts…). OKLCH ramps via `culori`; **APCA contrast enforced four ways** — derive `--text-on-accent` rather than ask; live "use #0E9E6B instead" suggestions in the picker; a publish-**blocking** health issue below threshold; and clamping at generation so even a neon accent yields usable subtle/link/border roles. Tokens are **server-rendered into a scoped `<style>`** — today's `useEffect` write to `documentElement` ([CMSContext.tsx:83-104](../src/cms/context/CMSContext.tsx#L83-L104)) flashes the default palette on every load.

## Phases

Each phase ends with a runnable, deployable app.

### Phase 0 — Make the repo publishable (~1 week)

> ### DONE — verified
>
> Every name occurrence removed, personal media and all ten trademarked client
> logos deleted, history squashed and force-pushed over `main`. MIT LICENSE,
> CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY.md, issue/PR templates, Dependabot,
> ESLint 9 flat config (`npm run lint` was previously a script with no eslint
> installed), Prettier, CI.
>
> **Verified:** the `check:personal-data` guard passes and runs in CI; gitleaks
> is clean across full history; 0 personal blobs reachable from any remote ref.
>
> **Fixed on the way:** the footer resume link never went through
> `resolveAssetUrl`, so an uploaded PDF produced a dead `idb:` href. And `xs:`
> was used but never declared as a Tailwind breakpoint, so the full-name
> wordmark was permanently hidden.

Do this **first**. Every hour spent migrating the owner's real content to Next.js is an hour spent moving something that must be deleted.

- Remove all 102 name occurrences; delete `src/data/*.ts` (10 files) and rewrite [initialData.ts](../src/cms/data/initialData.ts) as generic demo packs.
- Delete `public/` personal media (résumé, 2 photos, 4 client screenshots) and **all 10 client logos**. _Legal:_ MIT grants rights in our copyright, not in Bank Asia's trademark; nominative fair use covers the owner's own site, not redistribution to thousands of strangers. Replace with fictional CC0 wordmarks. Same for client screenshots (client IP, plausibly NDA'd). Delete the on-disk `dist/` (4 MB of copies).
- **Squash history to one orphan commit** — deleting files in a new commit does not remove the blobs from a repo about to go public.
- Rename storage keys under `opb.*`. Bundle format → `'open-portfolio-builder'` with `ACCEPTED_BUNDLE_FORMATS` compat (validated at [cmsService.ts:588](../src/cms/services/cmsService.ts#L588)) and a golden-file test.
- Fix hardcoded identity in [Navbar.tsx:57,58,95](../src/components/Navbar.tsx#L57-L58) — the only non-CMS-driven name in the UI.
- LICENSE (MIT), CONTRIBUTING (DCO, not CLA), CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY.md (GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting), issue/PR templates.
- ESLint 9 flat config + jsx-a11y + Prettier + `.editorconfig` (fixes the broken `lint` script). Delete dead code: `supabaseClient.ts`, `pdf-lib`, `AdminListRow.tsx`, 5 dead appearance fields, `revokeAllMediaBlobs`.
- CI: typecheck, lint, build, `check:personal-data` (denylist), gitleaks over full history, `knip`.
- Rotate the passcode currently in `.env.local` — it shipped in a client bundle.

### Phase 1 — Next.js scaffold + public site (2–3 weeks)

> ### DONE — verified
>
> Next.js 16 App Router. Per-route `generateMetadata`, Open Graph and Twitter
> tags drawn from the SEO settings that previously nothing read. `sitemap.ts`,
> `robots.ts`, a real 404, an error boundary, a skip link.
>
> **Verified:** all routes return 200, an unknown slug 404s, OG tags are present
> in the raw HTML, zero console errors in a real browser.
>
> **Deviations from plan:** `src/pages` became `src/views` (Next treats a
> `pages` directory as the Pages Router and refuses to build alongside `app`).
> The admin still runs on React Router inside one Next route — transitional,
> see Phase 7. Components were marked `'use client'` in bulk rather than pushed
> down to leaves; that optimisation is outstanding.
>
> **Fixed on the way:** `ThemeContext` read `localStorage` in a `useState`
> initialiser, so a stored light theme disagreed with the server and React
> discarded the server HTML for the entire tree.

Port `src/components/**` and `src/pages/**` bodies into `themes/default/**`. `'use client'` on the **17 files importing framer-motion**; `useCMS()` → props; `react-router-dom` → `next/link`. Port `src/styles/index.css:23-112` and `tailwind.config.js theme.extend`. Move the anti-flash theme script into `app/layout.tsx` with a CSP nonce. Delete `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`, `MainLayout.tsx`.
_Risk: theme hydration mismatch → keep the blocking script verbatim, `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>`, never branch on theme to produce markup._

### Phase 2 — Content core + tokens + primitives (2 weeks)

> ### TOKENS DONE — primitives and the publish gate remain
>
> **Done:**
>
> - `core/theme/contrast.ts` — WCAG contrast, derived readable foregrounds,
>   nearest-passing-shade suggestions.
> - `core/theme/tokens.ts` — 39 semantic tokens per mode, generated from the six
>   colours the appearance editor already collects. Every on-colour comes from
>   `readableForeground`, and anything that would fail 4.5:1 against its own
>   background is walked toward the readable extreme until it passes, so a neon
>   accent yields a usable site rather than an unreadable one.
> - Server-rendered into a `<style>` in `app/layout.tsx`. The palette is correct
>   at first paint; the `useEffect` that wrote six variables to
>   `documentElement` — and flashed the built-in colours on every load — now
>   runs only inside the draft preview, where the server genuinely does not know
>   the colours yet.
> - The hand-picked palettes are gone from `src/styles/index.css`. One source of
>   truth for every colour.
>
> **Verified:** 26 token tests, including seven hostile colour pairs (neon green
> on black, yellow on white, mid grey on mid grey) that must still produce
> readable body text and a legible label on an accent fill. The generated dark
> palette lands on the hand-picked one it replaced — `--text-primary` `#f5f5f2`,
> `--border-color-hover` `#2a2a2a` against the previous `#2b2b2b` — and a test
> pins that so a change to the mixing cannot quietly redesign the site.
>
> **Two bugs found by writing the tests, both mine:** the contrast walk took its
> direction from a luminance threshold while the foreground came from a contrast
> comparison, and the two disagree in the mid-tones, so a mid-grey background
> produced secondary text that failed at every step. And recession was expressed
> as a negative mix amount, which clamps to zero — the footer and every sunken
> surface came out exactly equal to the background. Sinking is now an absolute
> step toward black, which is the only form that reads as depth in both themes.
>
> **Remaining:**
>
> - ~~The ~17 primitives~~ **Done — 13 of them, plus the layout token half they
>   needed.** `core/primitives/` ships `Band`, `Measure`, `Stack`, `Grid`,
>   `Heading`, `Text`, `Eyebrow`, `Prose`, `Card`, `Divider`, `Media`, `Button`,
>   `Metric` and `Pill`, with `BlockFrame` and the heading-level context.
>
>   Building them surfaced something the plan had not accounted for: **there
>   were no non-colour tokens at all.** `tokens.ts` generated colour and nothing
>   else, so a primitive had no `--space-*`, `--measure`, `--radius-*` or type
>   scale to read. `core/theme/layout-tokens.ts` adds them, emitted once on
>   `:root` rather than duplicated into both mode blocks, since none of them
>   change between light and dark.
>
>   Every type step is a `clamp()`, so there is no way to produce a 72px
>   headline on a 390px screen. `Grid` uses
>   `auto-fit minmax(min(--card-min-N, 100%), 1fr)` and takes no breakpoint
>   props, so `columns: 4` is a maximum rather than a promise and cannot
>   overflow. `Heading` takes its _level_ from position and its _size_ from the
>   author, so reordering blocks cannot produce h1 → h3 → h2. `Media` requires
>   an alt decision — a `decorative` flag, not an optional field.
>
>   23 tests cover the invariants rather than the rendering: every surface pairs
>   a background with a foreground, every frame value resolves through a token
>   and never a literal, every enum member has a style, and the type scale
>   ascends without inverting at its small end.
>
>   Not built: `Overlay`, `Icon`, `Anchor`, `Metric`'s trend variant. They have
>   no consumer until blocks exist, and a primitive with no consumer is a guess.
>
> - An ESLint rule banning colour/size utilities and arbitrary values inside
>   `core/blocks/**` and `themes/**`. Without it the block/theme contract leaks.
>   `core/blocks/` still does not exist, so the rule has nothing to guard — write
>   it in the same change as the first block, not before and not after.
> - ~~The publish-time gate~~ **Done.** `core/theme/audit.ts` checks nine
>   foreground/background pairs in both modes; `contentHealth` reports it as
>   blocking, and `POST /api/admin/publish` refuses with 422 — enforcement at
>   the boundary, because the dashboard is advice and a direct call to the
>   endpoint must not be able to put unreadable text in front of visitors.
>   Scoped to contrast alone: other "blocking" health issues are judgement
>   calls, and refusing all of them would make publishing feel broken.
>
>   **Writing its tests found two real defects in the shipped palette.**
>   `--text-muted` was enforced at 3:1, but it carries captions, dates and meta
>   labels — small text, so 4.5:1 applies. It shipped at 4.22:1 in dark and
>   3.24:1 in light. And `--link-color` reused the accent's 3:1 value, shipping
>   links at 3.02:1 in light mode. Both now derive their own 4.5:1 value, which
>   costs some of the visual step down from secondary text — the right trade,
>   since a hierarchy nobody can read is not a hierarchy.
>
>   **And one defect in the audit itself:** it first held ordinary borders to
>   3:1, which failed the default palette at 1.12:1 and would have blocked every
>   new install from publishing. WCAG 1.4.11 covers components needed to
>   identify a control or its state, not decorative hairlines between sections.
>   Borders are no longer checked; the focus ring still is.
>
> - Fonts are still applied client-side by `loadGoogleFonts`, so the family name
>   is right only after hydration. Server-rendering them means getting the font
>   catalogue onto the server without dragging `react-icons` with it.
> - **Tailwind 4 — re-evaluated 2026-10-18; PR #7 stays closed (issue #9).**
>   It replaces the JS config with CSS-first `@theme`, and
>   `tailwind.config.js` stops being read, so a naive bump voids every
>   token-backed utility without failing a build. The guard now exists —
>   `css-build.test.ts` compiles the real stylesheet — and the full port is
>   verified on the `tailwind4-attempt` branch. The only question left is the
>   product call: v4 requires Safari 16.4+.
>
> The content core (schema, dates, health, listOps) was **not** moved into
> `core/` — it still lives under `src/cms/`. It works; tidy it when convenient.

`core/content/schema` (today's [cms.ts](../src/cms/types/cms.ts) moved + zod mirror), snapshot split, ports of `dates.ts`, `contentHealth.ts`, `listOps.ts`, `socialPlatforms.ts` (**split the react-icons half out** or it drags the icon library into every server module). Token generator + contrast validator + the 17 primitives + Default theme + the ESLint/CI bans.

### Phase 3 — Adapter contract + `local` + read path (2 weeks)

> ### DONE — verified
>
> `core/storage/contract.ts`, the `local` filesystem adapter, the registry that
> infers a backend from environment variables, and `getPublishedContent()`.
>
> **Verified:** a snapshot written to disk is picked up and rendered by the
> server, `<title>` included.
>
> **Deviations:** the `idb:` scheme and `src/cms/utils/mediaUrls.ts` still exist,
> because the admin continues to use IndexedDB for drafts — and, for content
> uploaded before uploads moved server-side, for media too. New uploads no
> longer use it. The bundle migration script the plan describes was never needed
> and does not exist.
>
> **Fixed on the way:** probing for the pre-rename database _created_ an empty
> one named after the original owner on every fresh install.

Contract, conformance suite, `local` adapter, `getPublishedSnapshot()` (React `cache` + `unstable_cache`, tag `content`). Wire `generateStaticParams`/`generateMetadata`/`sitemap.ts`/`robots.ts`/`opengraph-image.tsx` — **SEO works for the first time.**
_Riskiest step: media reference rewrite._ `scripts/migrate-bundle.ts` must be checksum-keyed, idempotent, resumable, `--dry-run` first. Silent data loss is the only unrecoverable failure in this plan.
_`generateStaticParams` must never fail the build_ — try/catch → `[]`, so a paused free-tier DB yields a dynamic site, not a red build.

### Phase 4 — Auth, before any admin UI (2 weeks)

> ### DONE — verified, but **passkeys were not built**
>
> scrypt-hashed passphrases, opaque session tokens in httpOnly cookies (only the
> SHA-256 is stored server-side), a 30-day sliding window inside a 90-day
> absolute limit, an owner epoch for "sign out everywhere", rate limiting,
> same-origin enforcement, and a first-run claim flow gated on
> `OPB_SETUP_TOKEN` in production.
>
> **Verified:** wrong passphrase and wrong email give identical rejections;
> publishing without a session returns 401; a cross-site POST returns 403; a
> second claim attempt is refused.
>
> **Passphrase reset by email now exists** (Phase 8), so a forgotten passphrase
> is no longer "delete a row from your own database". Tokens reuse the `otp` kv
> namespace; only the sha256 is stored, the token is burned before the
> passphrase changes, and `sessionEpoch` is bumped so whoever forced the reset
> does not keep a session they already held.
>
> **DEVIATION FROM A LOCKED DECISION:** the plan chose _passkey first, email OTP
> as recovery_. Neither ceremony is implemented — authentication is passphrase-only.
> This was a deliberate scope call rather than an oversight: passphrase auth
> already closes the bundled-secret hole, and WebAuthn plus an email provider is
> a phase of its own. **The session machinery is built to carry them** — add a
> verifier that returns an identity and call `createSession()`. For passkeys,
> `@simplewebauthn/server` and `@simplewebauthn/browser`.
>
> **Storage for passkeys is ready and the ceremonies are built:** every adapter
> exposes a `passkeys` surface, and `core/auth/passkey.ts` implements
> registration + authentication on `@simplewebauthn/server` v14 (single-use
> five-minute challenges in the `otp` kv namespace, rpID from `OPB_SITE_URL`
> with request-host fallback, clone detection on the signature counter, one
> failure message for every login failure). Four routes —
> `register/start|finish` (owner-only) and `login/start|finish` (public,
> rate-limited) — plus `list` and `[id]` for the settings screen, all covered
> by the route-guard AST test. The sign-in page offers all three methods and
> settings enrolls devices. **Email OTP recovery is built too**
> (`core/auth/otp.ts`, six digits, ten minutes, five guesses, hash-only
> storage, uniform responses), with `otp/request|verify` routes and a code
> form on the sign-in page. The locked decision — passkey first, email OTP as
> recovery, passphrase as the last resort — is now what ships.
>
> **Fixed on the way:** a **Host-header auth bypass I introduced** — the claim
> flow treated `Host: localhost` as proof the request was loopback, so a
> stranger could have claimed a deployed site without the setup token. Caught by
> an automated security review. The same pattern was in the cookie `Secure`
> decision. Both now derive from environment only.
> **Do not reintroduce header-derived authorization.**

Passkey + OTP + sessions + claim + CSRF + rate limiting + CSP/headers. `requireOwner()` **deny-by-default**. Delete [cmsService.ts:637-685](../src/cms/services/cmsService.ts#L637-L685) and `VITE_ADMIN_PASSCODE`.

### Phase 5 — Write path, publish, blocks, pages (3 weeks)

> ### PARTIALLY DONE — publishing works, **blocks and pages do not exist**
>
> **Done and verified:** `POST /api/admin/publish` writes the snapshot
> server-side and calls `revalidatePath`, so publishing genuinely reaches
> visitors. The contact form delivers to the server instead of into the
> sender's own browser. Both verified end to end against Postgres.
>
> **The block system now exists.** `core/blocks/` ships the versioned envelope,
> a registry, defensive parsing, per-block-type migrations, the renderer, and
> thirteen block types composed only from primitives. The `frame` vocabulary
> landed with the primitives in Phase 2.
>
> Seven hold what somebody typed into them — `hero`, `richText`, `image`,
> `gallery`, `stats`, `cards`, `ctaBanner`. Six hold a _rule_ about which
> records to show — `collection`, `timeline`, `logoWall`, `testimonials`,
> `skills`, `steps` — and the page follows the records. That second kind is the
> plan's "your stuff lives in collections; your pages arrange it", and until it
> existed the ten collections in the admin were reachable from no block at all:
> a person could build a page but not put their own work on it.
>
> Content reaches a block through `BlockContent`, passed down by the renderer
> rather than fetched inside the block — `Render` is synchronous, so a block
> that awaited its own content would be an async Server Component. It is
> deliberately narrow, and a test fails if `messages` ever appears in it.
>
> Three decisions in it are load-bearing:
>
> - **Nothing throws.** One malformed block costs that block, not the page. The
>   old content system validated the whole document at once, so a single bad
>   field blanked everything.
> - **Unknown and future blocks are quarantined, not dropped** — round-tripped
>   verbatim, so opening a page written by a newer build and saving it does not
>   silently strip what this build could not read.
> - **Versioning is per block type.** A hero change does not force every other
>   block to bump, and migrations run forward only: a block from a newer version
>   is quarantined rather than guessed at, because reading it optimistically is
>   how a downgrade corrupts data.
>
> **The ESLint boundary rule is in place** and verified by writing a deliberate
> violation of each of its four cases. Worth knowing: three of the four
> originally matched nothing, because an ESLint selector is a JavaScript string
> and `\d` was consumed as an escape before ESLint saw it. A rule that never
> fires proves exactly as much as a test that never fails.
>
> **A test caught a real design flaw before anyone met it:** `image` and
> `gallery` required a non-empty `src`, so adding either from the palette
> quarantined it instantly. A block is added before it is filled in — that is
> the whole interaction — so "not finished yet" belongs in a content check,
> where the answer is advice, not in the schema, where it is refusal.
>
> **Pages and routing now exist too.** `core/pages/` owns the record, the slug
> rules and the channel-aware read; `app/(site)/[...slug]` serves them. A page is
> an address, a title, an ordered list of blocks and its own SEO — and it joins
> the sitemap, the navigation and preview without any further wiring.
>
> Two deviations from the plan, both deliberate:
>
> - **`[...slug]`, not `[[...slug]]`.** An optional catch-all also matches `/`,
>   which collides with the home route and is a build error. Home stays a real
>   route until the theme's sections become blocks.
> - **Slugs are checked against the routes that exist.** Static routes beat a
>   catch-all, so a page whose slug is `work` would save, appear in the admin and
>   never once load. `checkSlug` refuses it and suggests `my-work` instead. A
>   test walks the route directories and fails if the reserved list drifts — so
>   adding `app/(site)/blog` in Phase 9 without reserving `blog` breaks the build
>   rather than shadowing somebody's page a release later.
>
> **Preview is real.** `draftMode()` plus a draft channel: `/api/preview` is
> owner-gated (a preview token in a URL ends up in a browser history and cannot
> be revoked), `/api/admin/draft` writes the draft snapshot, and the previewed
> page carries a banner that says so and offers the way out. Previewing a site

> - Authoring. Until Phase 7 there is no UI to create a page, so the seeded
>   example page is the only one — shipped as a draft, so nothing appears on a
>   stranger's live site that they did not publish.
>
> **The `work` merge (`projects` + `caseStudies`) landed 2026-10-18.**
> `projects` is the unified `work` collection; optional `story: { blocks }`
> decides depth (standard card vs rich multi-section case study). 301 redirects

Per-record writes with revision checks; publish (validate → version → bulkPut → `writeSnapshot` → `revalidateTag`); `draftMode()` preview replacing the `?preview=true` iframe. Block schema + registry + validation + migration harness + renderer with the first 6 blocks and the kitchen-sink matrix **from day one**. Catch-all `[[...slug]]` routing. Keep `MAX_VERSIONS = 20` and the snapshot-excludes-history decision ([cmsService.ts:284-298](../src/cms/services/cmsService.ts#L284-L298)) — both were right.

### Phase 6 — Adapters #2 and #3, _before_ the admin UI (2 weeks)

> ### DONE — verified, with one gap
>
> Supabase, Neon + Vercel Blob, **and** a generic Postgres adapter (a bonus that
> covers Railway, Render, Fly, Coolify and self-hosted). One shared SQL engine
> behind all three. A 21-assertion conformance suite that every backend must
> pass.
>
> **Verified:** 59 tests green against a real Postgres in Docker, including the
> atomic rate-limit counter, expiry, namespace isolation, the jsonb round-trip,
> and the rule that auth state never appears inside a content export. The whole
> app — claim, sign in, publish, serve — was run against Postgres end to end.
>
> **GAP:** file uploads to **Supabase Storage and Vercel Blob have still not
> been run against the live services.** The database half of both adapters is
> proven. The object-store half is now genuinely reachable — the admin uploads

> Supabase project or Blob store. Set the credentials, run
> `npx vitest run core/storage`, and upload one image through the admin before
> recommending either for production use.
>
> **Fixed on the way:** two genuine concurrency bugs in the local adapter, both

> are now serialised per path.

Supabase (built-in auth, presigned storage) and Neon+Vercel Blob (SQL, **no** built-in auth, separate blob service) — structurally the most different pair available. If the contract survives both plus `local`, it survives the rest. **Highest-leverage risk reduction in the plan; do not skip it to reach screens faster.**

### Phase 7 — Admin (4–5 weeks)

> ### IN PROGRESS — the page builder works end to end
>
> **The shadcn rebuild is cancelled.** This repo's `CLAUDE.md` names Astryx as
> the admin's design system and instructs every screen to be built from it.
> Rewriting a working Astryx admin in a second component library would be churn
> that contradicts the project's own standing instruction, and it would buy
> nothing a user can see. Phase 7 is therefore "build the missing screens in
> Astryx", not "rebuild the existing ones in shadcn".
>
> _(2026-10-18 — the kit is gone. The last Astryx component, the
> push-notifications island on /admin/messages, was ported to the same plain
> Tailwind every other admin screen uses; `@astryxdesign/*` and the orphaned
> `@stylexjs/stylex` left `package.json`, and `app/layout.tsx` stopped loading
> the kit's stylesheets. Nothing a visitor or an owner sees changed.)_
>
> **Built:** `/admin/pages` — create a page, set its address with live checking,
> choose draft or published, add blocks from a grouped palette, reorder, hide and
> remove them, edit every field, set per-page SEO, and preview. Verified in a
> browser end to end: sign in → add a block → publish → the page is live at its
> own address with a correct heading outline, while a draft stays 404 to the
> public.
>
> **Reorder is in the outline, not on a canvas** — as planned, and with buttons
> rather than `@dnd-kit`. Buttons work with a keyboard, work on a phone, and can
> be tested; dragging a pixel-perfect canvas is the demo that sells a builder and
> the interaction that excludes anyone not using a mouse.
>
> **Blocks describe their editor as data**, not as a component. `BlockField[]`
> on each definition, one generic form renders all of them. A per-block editor
> component would mean the thirtieth block type is a React file as well as a
> definition, and thirty chances to disagree about what a text field looks like.
> A test walks every field path against the real schema, because a typo in a
> path is invisible: the form renders, typing works, and the value lands
> somewhere the block never reads.
>
> **Three bugs found by loading the admin in a browser**, all pre-existing:
>
> - **Every sidebar link was broken.** They were absolute (`/admin/projects`)
>   inside a router with `basename="/admin"`, so they resolved to
>   `/admin/admin/projects`. Selection highlighting was permanently off for the
>   same reason. Nothing failed — the markup is valid and the destination
>   redirects — which is why it survived. Now covered by a test.
> - **The sign-in screen told people to look in `.env.local`** for a passcode
>   that has not existed since Phase 0 deleted `VITE_ADMIN_PASSCODE`.
> - **Drafts never reached the server.** `saveDraft` wrote to the editor's own
>   browser, so Preview could only ever show the published site — silently, via
>   the fallback. It now posts to `/api/admin/draft` with the revision it last
>   saw.
>
> **`<MediaPicker>` is built.** Every image field now opens the library rather
> than the operating system's file dialog — a file dialog can only ever add
> another copy of a picture that is already there, which was the last piece of
> bookkeeping the builder still asked a non-technical person to do by hand.
>
> **It asks for alt text at the moment of choosing**, with the picture on
> screen, and writes the description and the image together in one action.
> Every accessibility guide says to write alt text and almost nobody does,
> because the box is always somewhere other than where the picture is picked.
> It is still skippable on purpose: a hard requirement there is answered with a
> space bar, and " " is worse than nothing because it silences the warning too.
>
> **Still to do in this phase:**
>
> - Progressive disclosure on record editors, and collapse the five duplicate
>   settings routes into `settings/[panel]`.
> - A Home page built from blocks. The theme's fixed sections still own `/`.
> - The other record editors still use the pre-picker image field.
>
> **The one thing built here:** `src/admin/pages/AdminWelcome.tsx`, the first-run
> wizard, deliberately written in plain Tailwind so it survives the component
> kit being replaced. Do not port it to Astryx.
>
> Removing React Router marks the end of this phase. Note that paths inside
> `src/admin/**` are router-relative because of `basename="/admin"` — an
> absolute `/admin/login` resolves to `/admin/admin/login`.

`npx shadcn init`, AdminShell (sidebar IA ported as _data_ from [AdminSidebar.tsx:72-138](../src/admin/components/AdminSidebar.tsx#L72-L138)), **`<MediaPicker>` first** (it unblocks every image field and the fixed-4-slot problem), then the block builder (3-pane, `@dnd-kit` reorder **in the outline not the canvas** — keyboard-operable, touch-friendly, testable), then one record editor end-to-end as the template, then the rest. Progressive disclosure: Essentials → Details → SEO. Collapse the 5 duplicate settings routes into `settings/[panel]`.

### Phase 8 — Remaining 5 adapters + integrations (3 weeks)

> ### PARTIALLY DONE — registry, vault and SMTP-from-the-admin shipped; five adapters and OTP do not exist
>
> **Done and verified, against Mailpit:** an SMTP transport
> (`core/email/transport.ts`, `core/email/send.ts`) that reports a refused
> connection as a value rather than throwing, so a mail failure can never be
> mistaken for a lost enquiry. The contact form emails the owner when a message
> arrives — stored first, notified second, deliberately in that order
> (`app/api/contact/route.ts`). Passphrase reset by email (`core/auth/reset.ts`,
> `app/api/auth/reset/{request,confirm}/route.ts`,
> `src/admin/pages/AdminResetPassphrase.tsx`) closes the recovery path earlier
> phases left open — delete `.opb/state/owner.json` and claim the site again.
> The reset link's origin comes from `OPB_SITE_URL` only, never the `Host`
> header the claim flow was once tricked by; only `sha256(token)` is stored, in
> the existing `otp` kv namespace; the token is burned before the passphrase
> changes so a replay cannot land between the two; and confirming bumps

Cloudflare D1+R2, Firebase, Appwrite, PocketBase, Convex — each a PR with green conformance + docs page + `.env.example` block. Integration registry: one `IntegrationDefinition` per service (metadata, free-tier limits with a verified-on date, plain-English setup guide, zod schema, mandatory `test()` with non-technical remediation copy, CSP contribution, degradation mode) rendered by **one** generic admin screen. Secrets AES-256-GCM server-side, `import 'server-only'`, CI greps `.next/static/**` for secret values.
_Honest scoping:_ Vercel Marketplace can only auto-provision Marketplace-native products (Supabase, Neon, Upstash, Blob, Resend). Firebase, Appwrite, PocketBase and Cloudflare use the manual path — so adapter choice happens _after_ deploy for those, and the deploy form asks for **at most two fields** (`OWNER_EMAIL`, `SITE_NAME`). Behance's public API is retired and LinkedIn has no profile API — those imports are file-upload/paste flows, not connections.

### Self-hosting with Docker (added after the original plan)

>
> `output: 'standalone'` ships what the server actually imports rather than a

> check that asks the app over HTTP rather than only checking the process lives.
>
> **`OPB_DATA_DIR` is the load-bearing part.** The local adapter wrote to

### Phase 10 — Launch: site, demo, mobile (added after the original plan)

>
> **The demo is a product feature, not an environment.** `OPB_DEMO_MODE=1` gives

> saving service passwords and sending mail are refused at the endpoints rather
> than by hiding buttons, email most of all: a public form sending from a real
> domain is a spam relay within a day.
>
> It is a **build-time** flag as well as a run-time one. The adapter reads a

>
> **The PWA installs**, with a manifest built from the site's own settings and
> `start_url` pointing at `/admin` — nobody installs their own portfolio to look
> at it. No service worker yet, deliberately: Serwist's default configuration
> caches `GET /api/admin/messages` for 24 hours in an origin-scoped cache that
> logging out does not clear, and it is `NetworkOnly` in dev so it cannot be
> reproduced locally. The carve-out gets written before the feature.
>
> **Still missing from this phase:** the marketing site, the docs site, the
> mobile admin layout, and push.

> ### RESEARCHED, NOTHING BUILT
>
> Four dossiers, ~7,500 lines and ~580 sources, in `docs/research/`. They exist
> because the original plan ended at "1.0" and said nothing about how anybody
> would find this. Read them before building any of it — several findings
> invert the obvious approach.
>
> **The findings that change what we build, not just how we describe it:**
>
> - **The category name is not a query.** Nobody searches "open source portfolio
>   builder". Two audiences use vocabularies that never meet, which is a
>   positioning problem rather than a keyword problem.
> - **Profession pages are blocked, not deferred.** Six vocabulary packs that
>   rename section headings, against one theme, is Google's own doorway-page
>   example. Phase 9's themes and presets gate them.
> - **The industry is retreating from mobile editing.** Webflow retired its
>   legacy Editor on 2026-08-04; Wix cannot edit Editor sites in its app; Adobe
>   Portfolio says outright it does not support it. Nobody is competing here.
> - **Vercel Hobby forbids commercial use**, reportedly including soliciting
>   donations. A freelancer's portfolio is commercial use, and the README
>   currently recommends Hobby as the primary path. **This needs a decision.**
> - **Zero social proof is a solved problem.** Supabase shipped a homepage
>   showing a 6-star repo; Dub's showed 3. Both reframed it as "watch this"
>   rather than hiding it.
>
> **What this phase contains, in dependency order:**
>
> 1. **Go public and tag `v0.5.0`.** No dependencies, and the only item on a
>    clock — see `GOING-PUBLIC.md`. Publishing and announcing are separate
>    events; only the first is time-gated.
> 2. **A live demo.** Both surfaces, seeded with realistic content, resetting on
>    a schedule. "Demo" is a captured word — six of twenty-four projects use it
>    to mean "talk to sales" — so the label matters as much as the thing.
> 3. **The marketing site**, per `LANDING-PAGE.md`.
> 4. **Mobile and PWA**, per `MOBILE-AND-PWA.md`. Two hazards there must not be
>    got wrong: Serwist's default cache stores authenticated admin HTML for 24
>    hours in an origin-scoped cache, and Background Sync does not exist on iOS.
> 5. **Docs for non-technical people.** Ghost's persona-split navigation is the

### Phase 9 — Blog, newsletter capture, themes 2–6, presets, launch (4–5 weeks)

> ### DECIDED — it is "Writing", not a blog, and the label is the user's
>
> A blog is a _container_: dated, reverse-chronological, feed-driven. An article
> is one thing inside it. The question is therefore not what to call it but
> whether the ordering should be chronological — and for a portfolio it usually
> should not.
>
> - **The best piece sinks.** A strong essay from 2022 ends up below a throwaway
>   note from last week, which is the opposite of what a portfolio is for.
> - **A blog creates an obligation people break.** An empty blog, or one whose
>   newest post is eighteen months old, actively damages a portfolio — it reads
>   as abandoned. Three pieces under "Writing" reads as complete; the same three
>   under "Blog" with a year's gap reads as neglect.
> - **Portfolio writing is evergreen.** "How I approach research" does not
>   expire, and dating it prominently makes it look stale when it is not.
>
> **So: one collection, one editor, one route — with the label chosen by the
> owner**, through the same profession vocabulary packs that already rename
> sections. Developer → Blog. Designer → Writing. Photographer → Journal.
> Writer → Essays. Academic → Publications.
>
> It gets: optional dates, a choice between newest-first and manual order so a
> best piece can be pinned, and RSS regardless — it costs nothing and the people
> who want a feed want it badly. No comments by default.
>
> **The honest counter-argument, and why it does not change the answer:** for
> somebody chasing search traffic the blog format genuinely is better — dated,
> frequent, chronological. So chronological stays available as one setting
> rather than the product choosing for everybody. Default curated, because most
> portfolios are not traffic plays.
>
> **Case studies stay separate.** They are project-linked and differently
> shaped — client, role, outcome, images — and folding them into writing would
> lose all of that.
>
> Recorded as a decision rather than left to be re-argued. The evidence half is
> that a blog is a feature we currently lose on against Squarespace, Webflow and
> Ghost (`research/MARKET-RESEARCH.md`); the chronological-is-wrong-for-portfolios
> half is product judgement, not measured.

> ### MOSTLY DONE
>
> **Done:** the profession packs (`src/cms/data/professions.ts`), seven full
> presets, all six themes, Writing with RSS and predicate scheduling, and
> newsletter capture.
>
> **Newsletter capture, as built.** Double opt-in, tokens stored only as
> SHA-256, RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe, CSV export in the shape Buttondown
> and Mailchimp import. Three things came out differently from the sketch above:
>
> - **Subscribers are their own adapter surface**, not a field on the content
>   document — for the same reason the inbox is. Strangers append to it
>   concurrently, so a read-modify-write on a shared blob loses sign-ups; and
>   the content document is serialised into every public page and copied whole
>   by the backup button, neither of which may contain a list of email
>   addresses. The conformance suite asserts that a subscriber never appears in
>   a snapshot.
> - **Confirming is a POST from a page, not the emailed link itself.** Corporate
>   gateways and link-safety scanners open every URL in a message before its
>   recipient does, so a `GET` that confirms turns double opt-in quietly back
>   into single opt-in. The link opens a page; the page asks.
> - **The reply to a sign-up is identical whatever the truth is.** "You are
>   already subscribed" is a way to test, one query at a time, whether a given
>   person is on somebody's list.
>
> - **Where the list goes is a definition, not a sender.** Capture ships;
>   sending does not, because a mis-sent campaign to a stale list is not
>   something a self-hosting owner can undo. The recommendation sits on the
>   Services screen with every other service — self-hosted Listmonk (AGPL, one
>   binary, happy beside the Postgres this site already runs) — and the
>   Newsletter screen says so beside the download instead of leaving the exit
>   as a footnote. Nothing in the product calls Listmonk, so there is no key to
>   store: the definition exists to hold the address and to answer whether the
>   instance is actually up.
>
> **Also done, and not as specified.** The marketing site, a nine-page help
> centre and eight pages of developer docs, in `site/` — a separate application
> that builds to a static export. Fumadocs was installed and removed: the
> research picked it, and the same research insists the help centre look like
> the marketing site, which a second design system in one deployment cannot do.
> Plain Markdown with four-line frontmatter instead, nav and search generated
> from the directory.
>
> **And an interactive demo**, which the plan did not ask for at all. `/demo/try`
> runs thirteen admin screens and the published site in the browser with no
> server, importing this repository's real blocks, themes, content checks and
> editor metadata. It paid for itself immediately by falsifying two sentences
> that had been repeated across the README, the help centre and the homepage —
> see the note on stale copy in [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md).
>
> **Remaining in this phase:** the launch checklist. A hosted demo instance was
> considered and dropped — the browser demo and `docker-compose.demo.yml` cover
> it between them, and a hosted one is a thing somebody has to keep alive.
> The Tiptap rich-text editor and Giscus comments were not built — writing uses
> the same block editor as pages, which means every block added later works
> there without anyone doing anything, and comments on a portfolio were judged a
> moderation obligation rather than a feature.

Tiptap blog (structured JSON so posts render through token primitives in all 6 themes; markdown import/export so nobody is locked in). **Scheduling is a query predicate**, not a cron job — `status='published' OR (status='scheduled' AND published_at <= now())` applied everywhere, so a post appears within the cache window on any host with zero scheduler. RSS + JSON Feed + sitemap + Giscus. Newsletter capture with double opt-in, hashed tokens, RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe, CSV/Buttondown export. Themes 2–6 (pure token files by now). 7 fully authored presets. Docs site (Fumadocs, integration pages **generated from the registry** so they can't drift). Security review, a11y pass, Lighthouse budgets, 1.0.

## Verification

- **Conformance:** green for all 8. _As built:_ there is no `test:adapters` script — the suite runs under `npm run test`, and the hosted adapters skip unless credentials are present.
- **Kitchen sink:** every block × variant × 6 themes × light/dark × 390/768/1440 — axe-core zero serious/critical, zero horizontal overflow, visual snapshots.
- **Auth:** route-manifest test asserts every `/admin/*` and `/api/admin/*` rejects unauthenticated requests; claim flow tested against 5 named squatter scenarios; OTP expiry/single-use/lockout/concurrent-claim race.
- **Data safety:** export→import round-trip including the legacy golden-file bundle; migration importer `--dry-run` diff on the owner's real export before the real run.
- **E2E (Playwright, every PR):** fresh instance → claim → wizard → publish → name appears on the public site; edit→publish; contact submit lands in the inbox **and** sends the email.
- **Manual:** deploy the template to a clean Vercel account with no prior knowledge and reach a published personalised site without opening a terminal.
- **Budgets:** public route ≤130 KB gz initial JS, LCP ≤2.0s p75, CLS ≤0.05; Lighthouse ≥95 perf / 100 a11y / 100 SEO on mobile, enforced by LHCI.
- **Security gates:** no secret in `.next/static/**` (automated); zero gitleaks findings across full history; polyglot JPEG, SVG with `onload`, 500 MB file and HTML-named-`.pdf` all rejected; clean securityheaders.com and Mozilla Observatory on a default deploy.

## Critical files

- [src/cms/types/cms.ts](../src/cms/types/cms.ts) — the domain schema; the most valuable asset in the repo, moves near-verbatim to `core/content/schema/types.ts`
- [src/cms/services/cmsService.ts](../src/cms/services/cmsService.ts) — the 691-line singleton being dissolved; contains the auth to delete (637-685), publish/version logic to keep (269-329), bundle format (23-30, 561-616), and the broken contact form (421)
- [src/cms/services/storage/types.ts](../src/cms/services/storage/types.ts) — today's `ContentStore`, replaced by `adapters/contract.ts`
- [src/cms/utils/mediaUrls.ts](../src/cms/utils/mediaUrls.ts) — the `idb:` scheme to delete before any adapter work
- [src/views/HomePage.tsx](../src/views/HomePage.tsx) — the fixed `SECTION_COMPONENTS` registry the block registry replaces. `src/pages` was renamed `src/views` in Phase 1, because Next reserves `pages`
- [src/cms/utils/contentHealth.ts](../src/cms/utils/contentHealth.ts) — 304 lines of genuinely good product thinking; decomposes into per-block checks + the publish gate + the new Security page
- [src/styles/index.css](../src/styles/index.css) — the token indirection the semantic layer replaces
- [src/admin/components/AdminRecord.tsx](../src/admin/components/AdminRecord.tsx) — the interaction model to carry into shadcn

## Risks

1. **Media reference rewrite (Phase 3)** — the only unrecoverable failure mode. Idempotent, checksum-keyed, resumable, dry-run first.
2. **Contract surviving adapters #2/#3 (Phase 6)** — getting this wrong invalidates Phases 7–9. This is why adapters come before screens.
3. **Scope.** Everything decided is designed for, but the honest read is ~5 months to launch. The mitigation is that the _architecture_ is complete before the _content_ is: adding the 9th adapter, the 26th integration or the 8th preset must be one file and zero React changes. If the calendar bites, ship presets and adapters as `experimental` rather than cutting the seams that make them cheap.
4. **7 presets × 6 themes × 3 breakpoints = 126 combinations** to review. The kitchen-sink CI matrix does the mechanical half; the taste half is manual.
5. **Free-tier drift.** Every integration's free-tier claim carries a `verifiedOn` date and a monthly CI-opened re-verification issue.

## Handover, and the decisions still open

**Operational notes live in [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md), not here.** How to run
it, which containers the suite needs, the test counts to expect, the traps that
have already cost time, the invariants, the known defects and what to do next
are all in that one file.

They used to be duplicated in this section. Two copies of a fact means one of
them goes stale, and one already had: the Postgres container command drifted
between the two, and the version people were more likely to read omitted
`POSTGRES_DB` — producing ninety failing tests that look like a code bug. This
section is now a pointer so that cannot happen again.

What stays below is the part that belongs to a _plan_ rather than to a handover:
where the built thing knowingly departs from what was designed, and which
choices are still the maintainer's to make.

### Deliberate deviations from the plan above

These are decisions, not oversights, and the reasoning is in each phase block:

- **Passphrase auth instead of passkeys.** Reset by email now exists; passkeys
  and OTP still do not. The session machinery supports adding them.
- **`src/pages` renamed `src/views`.** Next reserves `pages`.
- **The admin still runs React Router** inside one Next route, on purpose, so
  the framework migration could land without also rewriting twenty screens.
- **`work`/`timeline` collection merges not done.** Still four collections.
- **Content core still lives in `src/cms/`,** not `core/content/`.
- **Tailwind 4 re-evaluated 2026-10-18** — ported and verified on the
  `tailwind4-attempt` branch; the pin waits only on the Safari 16.4+ product
  call (issue #9).
- **Folder layout differs from the plan above.** There is no top-level
  `/adapters`, `/themes`, `/integrations` or `/presets`. Storage lives in
  `core/storage/adapters/`, and the theme and integration directories do not
  exist yet, so the ESLint boundary rules the plan specifies have nothing to
  guard.
- **No `demo-idb` adapter.** The client-only demo mode behind
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPB_DEMO=1` was specified and never built. Nothing depends on it.
- **The conformance suite is `core/storage/conformance.ts`,** not
  `/adapters/_conformance/suite.ts`, and it is 21 assertions rather than the
  ~60 the plan estimated — because the surfaces it has to cover are narrower
  than the contract that was designed.
- **`messages` is an addition, not a deviation.** The contract grew a surface
  the original did not have, for the reason recorded in Phase 5: an inbox and a
  content document have different writers and different failure modes.
- **The integrations registry was deferred behind its first integration.** SMTP
  was built concretely first, on the reasoning that an abstraction over
  twenty-five services designed from zero examples is wrong in ways only a
  second consumer reveals. Build Turnstile next, then extract the registry from
  the two of them.

### Open decisions — the maintainer's, not an engineer's

These are not blocked on work. They are choices about the product.

| Decision                                | State                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Make the repository public**          | Audited and clean. Five shipped features are broken until it happens, and three discovery channels count months from that day. See `research/GOING-PUBLIC.md` |
| **Tag a first release**                 | Three features read GitHub Releases and find nothing. Do it after verifying uploads                                                                           |
| **Vercel Hobby's non-commercial terms** | Now quoted and dated in the README, without interpretation. Nothing further is needed unless you want to change the primary recommendation                    |
| **Feedback route**                      | Settled: GitHub device flow. Needs one OAuth App created once, and `OPB_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` set. Until then the admin falls back to opening a pre-filled tab    |
