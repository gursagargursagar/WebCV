 * Profession vocabulary packs.

 * The whole information architecture was built for a designer: "Selected work",
 * "Case studies", "Visual explorations". A photographer, a developer and a
 * student all need the same underlying structure and completely different
 * nouns for it.
 *
 * These change wording only — never structure. That matters: switching packs
 * has to be safe at any point, and it is only safe if nothing a user has
 * written can be moved or dropped by it. The full preset system (different
 * section arrangements and demo content per profession) builds on top of this.
