/**
 * The web app manifest, built from the site's own settings.
 *
 * Installing matters more than it looks. Chrome began automatically revoking
 * notification permission from low-engagement sites in October 2025 and
 * explicitly exempts installed web apps; iOS 16.4 onwards only delivers web
 * push to a site added to the Home Screen at all. So "install this" is not a
 * nicety — it is the precondition for ever telling somebody a message arrived.
 *
 * `start_url` is `/admin` rather than the public site, deliberately. Nobody
 * installs their own portfolio to look at it; they install it to edit it from a
 * phone, and opening the marketing side of their own site would be a small
 * daily annoyance for the one person guaranteed to have it installed.
