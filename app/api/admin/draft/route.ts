/**
 * Saving work without showing it to anyone.
 *
 * The draft channel is what preview reads. Without it, "preview" could only
 * ever mean "the site as published", which is the one thing you never need to
 * preview.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* subject to the contrast gate that publishing runs. A draft
 * with an unreadable palette is a work in progress; refusing to save it would
 * mean losing an afternoon's writing over a colour that was going to be changed
 * anyway. The gate belongs at the moment content becomes public, and that is
 * where it stays.
 */

/**
 * The draft, and the revision it is on.
 *
 * It returns the content as well as the number because the admin needs to be
 * able to *load* it. It could not, and the consequence was severe: opening the
 * admin on a second machine — or after clearing your browser — showed the
 * built-in demo content, and the first autosave pushed that over the real
 * draft. The local store is a cache; this is the source of truth.
 *
 * Owner-only, obviously: this is the unpublished site.
