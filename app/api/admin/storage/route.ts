 * The admin could not previously tell. `storeName` and `isDurable` in the CMS
 * context describe the *browser's* IndexedDB draft store, not the server's
 * backend — so a settings screen reading them would confidently report the
 * wrong thing, which is worse than reporting nothing.
 *
 * Owner-only. The adapter's identity is not secret, but its health check
 * carries the database's own error text, and a connection string with a
 * password in it turns up in those more often than anyone would like.
