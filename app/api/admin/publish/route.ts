 * Publishing, at last.

 * Until now "Publish" only moved content between two copies inside the
 * editor's own browser, so a visitor never saw any of it. This writes the
 * published snapshot to the server's store and clears the cached pages, which
 * is what makes the button mean what it says.
 *
 * Owner-only, and the check lives in this handler rather than in middleware or
 * a layout — a route handler is a public HTTP endpoint no matter what rendered
 * the button that calls it.
