/**
 * Leaving.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** origin-checked, which is the one place in this codebase
 * that rule is relaxed. RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe is a POST issued by the
 * recipient's mail provider — Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail — with no `Origin` of
 * ours, and rejecting it is how a mail client's unsubscribe button ends up
 * doing nothing. The token *is* the credential.
 *
 * The risk that trade buys is a cross-site request that unsubscribes somebody,
 * which requires already knowing their 256-bit token, and whose worst outcome
 * is that a person stops receiving email they can sign up for again. Weighed
 * against an unsubscribe button that silently fails, this is not close.
 *
 * The token is read from the query string as well as the body because that is
 * what providers send.
