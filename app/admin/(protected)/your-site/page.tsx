/**
 * The address to send people to, and how to get a nicer one.
 *
 * Server-rendered: the URL, the platform and the published state are all
 * known on the server, so the old version's loading flash and its "we do
 * not know" limbo were never necessary — only the copy button needs a
 * browser, and that is one client island.
 *
 * The domain half is guidance and not a control, deliberately. Adding a
 * domain from here would mean holding a hosting API token that can modify
 * the person's entire account, to save four clicks in a dashboard they
 * already have open.
