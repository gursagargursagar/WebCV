/**
 * Whether the owner has chosen to leave the first-run wizard.
 *
 * The wizard is shown by inferring "never set up" from the content itself —
 * `settings.fullName` still holding the seed's placeholder. That inference is
 * right for deciding whether to *offer* the wizard and wrong for deciding
 * whether to *force* it: someone who skipped has, by definition, not changed
 * their name yet, so the guard sent them straight back and the Skip button did
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * A dismissal is a UI preference belonging to this browser, not site content —
 * it must not travel in an export or reach a visitor — so localStorage is the
 * right home for it, alongside the theme.
 *
 * Moved here from the legacy admin's `src/admin/welcomeDismissed.ts` when the
 * old shell was deleted; `welcome-gate.tsx` and the wizard leaf are the only
 * callers.
