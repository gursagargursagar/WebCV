 * every real upgrade, it never ran again. New tables were never created and
 * enquiries left in an old snapshot were never migrated out of it before the

 *
 * So it happens here instead: lazily, once per process, in front of the first
 * use of the backend. Every consumer goes through this one function, so there
 * is no path to an unprovisioned adapter. The promise is memoised rather than
 * the act of provisioning, which is what makes concurrent callers on a cold
 * start share one attempt instead of racing several — and what makes the
 * caller *wait* for it, rather than reaching a table that is still being
 * created.
 *
 * `provision()` is idempotent and cheap on an already-provisioned store, so
 * paying it once per cold start costs a round trip and buys the guarantee.
