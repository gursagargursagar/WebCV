 * Moves enquiries out of the content snapshot and into the messages surface.

 * Runs from `provision()`, which the registry performs once per process in
 * front of the first use of the backend — so an instance that was claimed
 * before this upgrade migrates on its next cold start rather than never.
 * Guarded on the destination being empty, and every backend's `append` ignores
 * a duplicate id, so several instances starting at once cannot produce
 * duplicates between them.
