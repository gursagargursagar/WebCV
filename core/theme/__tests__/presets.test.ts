 * Every theme, against the gate that refuses to publish.
 *
 * This is the test that had to exist before any of these shipped. The publish
 * route runs `auditContrast` and returns 422 on failure, so a theme whose
 * palette fails it is not a theme somebody can use — it is a trap that lets
 * them pick it and then refuses to let them publish, with no obvious connection
 * between the two screens.
 *
 * It also catches the thing colour choices are worst at: looking fine in the
 * mode you happened to design in.
