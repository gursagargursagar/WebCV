/**
 * Audits a generated palette for pairs a reader could not actually read.
 *
 * The token generator already derives every on-colour and walks anything that
 * would fail toward the readable extreme, so in normal use this finds nothing.
 * It exists for the cases the generator cannot fix: a background and an accent
 * so close together that no shade of one is legible on the other. Something has
 * to notice that before it reaches a visitor, and the person who chose the
 * colours is the least likely to — they picked them because they like them.
 *
 * Separate from `contentHealth` so the same answer is available at the publish
 * boundary, in the appearance editor, and in a test, without any of them
 * importing a report format they do not need.
