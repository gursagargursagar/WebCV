/**
 * Every colour the site paints, derived from six a user actually picks.
 *
 * The appearance editor asks for an accent, a background and a stroke colour,
 * per mode. Everything else — surfaces, secondary and muted text, hover states,
 * the label colour on an accent-filled button — is computed here. That is the
 * whole point: a person choosing a brand colour is not choosing a design
 * system, and asking them to pick "the text colour that goes on top of the
 * accent" is asking them to fail.
 *
 * Two rules hold for every value produced:
 *
 * 1. **Foregrounds are derived, never requested.** `--text-on-accent` comes
 *    from `readableForeground`, so a yellow accent gets dark text and a navy
 *    one gets light text without anybody deciding.
 * 2. **Text is clamped at generation.** A derived colour that would fail 4.5:1
 *    against the surface it sits on is walked toward the readable extreme until
 *    it passes. A neon accent still yields usable subtle, link and border roles
 *    rather than an unreadable site.
 *
 * Sits alongside `contrast.ts` and shares its constraints: no dependencies, no
 * framework, so the same code runs in the editor, on the server at render time,
 * and in tests.
