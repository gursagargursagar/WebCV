/**
 * One service, described once.
 *
 * The point of this shape is that adding the twenty-fifth integration is a data
 * file and no React at all. The admin has one screen; it reads these; every
 * service gets the same setup flow, the same test button and the same honest
 * account of what happens when it is switched off.
 *
 * Four of these fields exist specifically because the audience is somebody
 * deploying this without a developer:
 *
 * - **`freeTier`** carries a `verifiedOn` date. A free-tier claim with no date
 *   on it is a rumour, and the whole promise of this project is that a person
 *   can run it without a bill.
 * - **`setup`** is numbered plain-English steps, not a link to a docs site.
 * - **`test`** is mandatory. "Saved" is not the same as "works", and finding out
 *   which at the moment a stranger sends you a message is too late.
 * - **`degradation`** says what the site does without it, in words the owner
 *   can act on.
