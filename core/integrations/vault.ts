 *
 * **Not in the content snapshot.** That document is serialised into the HTML of
 * every public page and is what "export my site" hands you as a file. An SMTP
 * password in there is published, then emailed to whoever the backup was shared
 * with. Credentials go in the `config` namespace, which nothing public reads.
 *
 * **Encrypted at rest.** A backend leak, a shared database, a support engineer
 * reading a table — none of those should hand over the keys to somebody's mail
 * account. AES-256-GCM, which is authenticated: a tampered ciphertext fails to
 * decrypt rather than decrypting to something attacker-chosen.
 *
 * **Never sent back to the browser.** The admin gets to know a secret is *set*,
 * and its last four characters, and nothing else. An admin screen that
 * round-trips a password so it can show it in a field is one XSS away from
 * handing it over, and it gains nothing: nobody needs to read a key they
 * already pasted in.
