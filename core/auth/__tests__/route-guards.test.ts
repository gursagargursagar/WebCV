/**

 * This is the mechanism that makes "an unprotected admin route is impossible"
 * true rather than aspirational. A layout guard does not protect a route
 * handler: a handler is a public HTTP endpoint, reachable regardless of what
 * rendered the button that normally calls it, and forgetting `requireOwner()`
 * in a new file produces no error, no warning and no visible symptom — the
 * route simply works for everybody.
 *
 * So it is checked mechanically, on the syntax tree rather than with a text
 * search, and a new route is guarded-by-default: unknown files fail until
 * somebody either adds the check or writes down why it is public.
