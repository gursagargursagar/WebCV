 * The interesting problem here is not the record, it is the slug. A file-system

 * pages, so a page whose slug collides with a real route is not an error
 * anywhere: it saves, it appears in the admin, and it silently never loads.
 * That is the worst failure mode available — the user is certain they made the
 * page, and they did. So the collision is caught where it is created, in
 * language that says what to do about it.
