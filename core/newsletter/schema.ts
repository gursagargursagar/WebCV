 * Collecting email addresses, and nothing more.

 * obligations — deliverability, bounce handling, list hygiene, an unsubscribe
 * link that works on the first click — and shipping half of it would leave
 * somebody with a list they cannot legally or practically mail.
 *
 * **Double opt-in is not optional.** Anyone can type anyone's address into a
 * form on the internet. Without confirmation a list is a mix of real
 * subscribers and people who never asked, and mailing that list is how a
 * domain's reputation is destroyed. It is also what GDPR means by consent.
 *
 * The tokens are hashed for the same reason session tokens are: a leaked
 * database should not hand somebody the ability to confirm or unsubscribe
 * anybody.
