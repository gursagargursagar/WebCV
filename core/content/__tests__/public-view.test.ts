/**
 * What ends up in the HTML of a public page.
 *
 * The whole content document was being serialised into every page so the
 * client could render the navbar and footer — drafts included. Unpublished
 * pages and unfinished writing, with their titles, summaries and full block
 * content, readable by anyone who pressed view-source.
 *
 * Nothing rendered them, which is precisely why nobody noticed: the page looked
 * right. Found by counting occurrences of a draft title in the served HTML.
