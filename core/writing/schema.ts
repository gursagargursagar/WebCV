 * Writing — the thing most products call a blog.

 * `docs/PLAN.md` under Phase 9. Briefly: a blog is a *container* whose defining
 * property is reverse-chronological order, and for a portfolio that ordering is
 * usually wrong. A strong essay from three years ago sinks below last week's
 * throwaway, and an empty blog — or one whose newest post is eighteen months
 * old — actively damages a portfolio, because the format itself implies an
 * obligation the owner has visibly broken.
 *
 * So: dates are optional, order can be manual, and chronological is a setting
 * rather than the shape of the thing. Somebody chasing search traffic can have
 * the blog behaviour; nobody else has to inherit its social contract.
