 * Which mail transport this instance has, decided by environment alone.

 * Mirrors `core/storage/registry.ts`: the presence of a variable selects the
 * backend, so nobody has to choose one in a settings screen before they have a
 * database to store the choice in.
 *
 * `OPB_`-prefixed because no platform sets `SMTP_HOST` for you. The storage
 * adapters accept vendor names — DATABASE_URL, BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN —
 * precisely because the platform writes those.
 *
 * Precedence, fixed now so a vault is additive later rather than a migration:
 * an environment variable wins if present; otherwise stored config, once
 * stored config exists.
