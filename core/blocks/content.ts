 * The site's own records, as a block sees them.
 *
 * The half of "your stuff lives in collections; your pages arrange it" that did
 * not exist. Every block until now took literal props — a headline somebody
 * typed, cards they filled in by hand — so a person could build a page but
 * could not put their own projects, clients or experience on it. Ten
 * collections sat in the admin, reachable from nowhere.
 *
 * Passed down from the renderer rather than fetched inside a block, for the
 * same reason `headingLevel` is: `Render` is a synchronous component and the
 * test harness drives it through `renderToStaticMarkup`. A block that awaited
 * its own content would be an async Server Component, which is a different
 * thing that cannot be rendered that way. `getPublishedContent()` is React-
 * cached, so a route reading it again to pass it down costs nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. Blocks get the records they might place and not the
 * whole `CMSState` — no settings, no SEO, no media library, and above all no
 * `messages`, because the contact inbox has no business being one careless prop
 * spread away from the public page.
