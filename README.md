Built for people who need a portfolio but should not have to learn a framework
to keep one: students, designers, developers, photographers, writers.

## Deploy your own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FShadmanArafin%2Fopen_portfolio&project-name=my-portfolio&repository-name=my-portfolio&env=OPB_SETUP_TOKEN&envDescription=Invent+any+long+phrase.+You+will+be+asked+for+it+once%2C+to+prove+the+site+is+yours.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FShadmanArafin%2Fopen_portfolio%23what-happens-on-first-run&stores=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22blob%22%2C%22access%22%3A%22public%22%7D%5D)

Vercel copies this repository into your own GitHub account, provisions a free
Neon Postgres database and a Blob store for your images, and asks you to invent
one setup phrase. Then open your new site, claim it with that phrase, and answer
four questions.

No keys to find, nothing to install. The database connection string and the blob
token are set for you and you never see either.

> If the button ever stops provisioning them, deploy anyway and add **Neon** and
> **Blob** from your project's Storage tab. The app uses whichever backend's
> environment variables are present, so nothing else changes.

### Before you use Vercel's free plan, read this

Vercel's Hobby plan is **non-commercial only**, and their definition is broader
than most people expect. From their
[fair use guidelines](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines)
(checked 12 August 2026):

> **Hobby teams** are restricted to non-commercial personal use only. All
> commercial usage of the platform requires either a Pro or Enterprise plan.
>
> Commercial usage is defined as any Deployment that is used for the purpose of
> financial gain of **anyone** involved in **any part of the production** of the
> project […] Examples of this include, but are not limited to […] **Advertising
> the sale of a product or service** […]
>
> Asking for Donations fall under commercial usage.

A portfolio that exists to get you hired, or that lists services you charge for,
may well fall inside that. A student's coursework portfolio almost certainly
does not. We are not going to tell you which side of the line your site is on —
that is Vercel's call, not ours, and their page says to
[ask their support team](https://vercel.com/help#issues) if you are unsure.

What we will say plainly: **if your portfolio advertises work you are paid for,
budget for Vercel Pro or use one of the options below instead.** Running it on
your own server has no such restriction, and neither does any host you pay for
in the ordinary way.

We have not checked whether Netlify's free tier carries an equivalent clause, so
do not read its presence here as an endorsement of it for commercial sites.

## Try it without installing anything

The marketing site carries a demo of the admin and the published site that runs
entirely in your browser — no account, no server, nothing saved. Seven
professions and six themes, and it renders with the product's real blocks and
themes rather than with screenshots.

It is the admin, not a picture of it: build the page, add and delete blocks,
reorder them, change the theme, publish, and open the result full size in its own
tab. What is simulated is persistence, sign-in, uploads and email.

For the full thing, with real saving, uploads and email:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up
```

Every visitor gets their own copy of the site, in memory, thrown away after an
hour — so the editor is fully usable and there is nothing to vandalise. Sign in
with the details printed on the page.

Uploading, sending email and saving service passwords are switched off, because
a public sandbox that can do any of those becomes somebody else's file host or
spam relay within a day of being noticed.

## Run it on your own server

One command, on any machine with Docker. No account anywhere, no platform that
can change its terms, and nothing that phones home.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and follow the setup. That brings up the app and a
Postgres database together; change `OPB_SETUP_TOKEN` and `OPB_SECRET_KEY` in
`docker-compose.yml` first.

Just the app, against a database you already have — from a released image, for
amd64 or arm64, so nothing is built on your machine:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v opb-data:/data \
  -e OPB_POSTGRES_URL="postgres://…" \
  -e OPB_SETUP_TOKEN="a long phrase you invent" \
  -e OPB_SECRET_KEY="a different long phrase" \
  ghcr.io/shadmanarafin/open_portfolio:latest
```

Use your own phrases: the two examples above are public, so a site still running
on them refuses to be claimed. Each released image carries a signed record of the
commit and workflow that built it, which you can check before running it:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/shadmanarafin/open_portfolio:latest --owner ShadmanArafin
```

Building it yourself instead is `docker build -t open-portfolio .` and the same
`docker run` with `open-portfolio` as the image.

**The volume matters.** `/data` is where uploads and — if you are not using a
database — your content live. Without it, replacing the container deletes your
site. With it, you can throw the container away and rebuild it as often as you
like: that is exactly what updating does, and your content is untouched.

## Run it locally

**Requirements:** Node.js 22 or newer, and npm. Nothing else — no database is
needed to try it, and no account anywhere.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadmanArafin/open_portfolio.git
cd open_portfolio
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. You will be sent to `/setup` to claim the site.
Content is stored under `.opb/` — delete that folder to start over.

## What happens on first run

1. **Claim the site at `/setup`.** You give an email and a passphrase, and that
   becomes the only account that can edit it. On a public host you also enter
   your `OPB_SETUP_TOKEN`, which is what stops a stranger who finds the URL
   before you from taking ownership.
2. **Answer four questions.** Your name and what you do, the kind of work you
   show, a colour, then publish. The second question renames sections to
   language that fits your field — a photographer gets _Portfolio_ and _Brands
   I've shot for_ where a developer gets _Projects_ and _Stack_. It changes
   wording only, so nothing you have written can be lost by it.
3. **You have a live site.** Demo projects stay as examples until you replace
   them, and the dashboard lists whatever is still unfinished with a link to the
   screen that fixes it.

Every step is skippable. None of it is permanent.

## Features

### Build

- **Writing.** Essays, notes, posts — called whatever fits what you do, built
  from the same blocks as your pages, with RSS. Ordered the way you choose
  rather than newest-first, so your best piece stays at the top instead of
  sinking under last week's note. Scheduling works with nothing running.
- **A mailing list, without a mailing-list account.** Switch on a sign-up box
  and visitors can ask to hear from you. Everybody confirms by email before
  they are on the list, leaving takes one press from the mail client itself,
  and the list downloads as a CSV that Buttondown, Mailchimp and the rest
  import directly. Nothing sends from here — the export is the exit, not a
  lock-in.
- **Seven starting points.** Design, Software, Photography, Writing, Research,
  Student or something else — each one sets the wording, the theme and what your
  writing section is called, and every part of it can be changed afterwards.
- **Installable.** Add the editor to your phone's home screen and it opens like
  an app.
- **Six themes.** Editorial, Terminal, Gallery, Warm, Bold and Minimal — each
  changes colour, typeface, spacing and corner radius together, and every one is
  checked against the same contrast rules that block publishing. Pick one and
  change anything you like on top; your changes always win.
- **A visual page builder.** Add blocks, drag them into order, hide them, edit
  every field. Twenty-seven block types. Twenty you fill in yourself - hero,
  text, image, gallery, numbers, cards, a call to action, a contact form,
  questions and answers, a video, a booking embed, a post from Instagram,
  Behance or Substack, a picture beside text, a quote, a newsletter box,
  comments, your social links, what you offer, a file to download, and space -
  and seven that show what you have already entered:
  your work, your writing, experience, clients, recommendations, what you do
  and how you work. Those follow the records, so updating a project
  updates every page showing it. Reordering is buttons in an outline rather
  than dragging a canvas, so it works with a keyboard and on a phone.
- **A contact form you can put anywhere**, not only at `/contact`. And a video
  block that loads nothing from YouTube until a visitor presses play — most of
  them never will, and that is half a megabyte and some third-party state you
  did not agree to on their behalf.
- **Any number of pages**, each at its own address, each with its own title and
  description for search results. If you pick an address the site already uses,
  it says so and suggests one that works instead of quietly 404ing later.
- **Your home page too**, built the same way. Until you publish one, the theme's
  own layout keeps rendering, so nothing changes until you decide it should.
- **A media library.** Pick a picture you have already uploaded rather than
  uploading it twice — and write its description at the moment you choose it,
  which is the only point anybody actually does.
- **Advice while you type.** A headline that will wrap to four lines on a phone,
  a gallery of one, an image with no alt text, one card stranded on the last
  row. Advice, never a refusal.

### Publish

- **Draft and publish.** Each screen saves to a draft when you press Save (or
  Cmd/Ctrl+S), and asks before you leave with changes unsaved. The live site keeps
  showing the published version until you publish.
- **Preview before anyone else sees it**, at the page's real address, with a
  banner so you never mistake a draft for the live site.
- **Version history.** Every publish snapshots the content and any version can be
  restored. Capped at 20 so storage stays flat.
- **Colour contrast is checked before publishing.** A palette nobody could read
  is refused, not warned about.
- **A dashboard that tells you what is missing** — a run of checks over the
  published content, each linking to the screen that fixes it.

### Run

- **Real SEO.** Every page is server-rendered with its own title, description,
  Open Graph and Twitter tags. `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` come from your
  content.
- **A contact form that works.** Messages land in an inbox inside the admin, and
  email you when they arrive.
- **Connect services from the admin.** A mail server, without an environment
  variable or a redeploy — press Test and it tells you what is wrong in words
  you can act on. Passwords are encrypted and never sent back to the browser.
- **Ask for things without leaving the admin.** Report a bug or request a
  feature: it checks whether somebody already said it — or whether it is already
  fixed in a newer version — attaches your version and setup, and files it under
  your own GitHub account so you are credited when it lands.
- **Your data, your database.** Pick a backend or let the deploy button provide
  one. Export everything as a single JSON file at any time.
- **Updates never touch your content.** It lives in your database; an update
  only changes code. See [docs/UPDATING.md](docs/UPDATING.md).

## Choose a backend

| Backend                 | Free tier                 | Works on Vercel/Netlify | Best for                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Local filesystem**    | free forever, no account  | no                      | trying it out, a VPS, Docker, a Raspberry Pi                       |
| **Supabase**            | 500MB database, 1GB files | yes                     | one account for everything; free projects pause after ~1 week idle |
| **Neon + Vercel Blob**  | 0.5GB database, 1GB blob  | yes                     | deploying on Vercel; resumes instantly after idling                |
| **Postgres (any host)** | depends on your host      | no                      | Railway, Render, Fly, Coolify, or a database you already run       |
| **PocketBase**          | free forever, self-hosted | no                      | one binary for database + files on your own server                 |
| **Firebase**            | Spark plan free           | no                      | Firestore + Storage when you already live in Google's console      |
| **Appwrite**            | free, self-hosted/Cloud   | no                      | documents + files with a full console when you want one            |
| **Cloudflare D1+R2**    | free, local engine        | no                      | D1 SQLite + R2 objects on your own server, no account              |

You do not choose in advance. Whichever service's environment variables are
present is the one that gets used, so provisioning a database is the only step.
See [.env.example](.env.example).

Adding another backend is one file implementing `StorageAdapter`, one line in the
registry, and a green run of the conformance suite — ~50 assertions covering
round-tripping, concurrent writes, expiry, namespace isolation, passkey
storage, and the rule that auth state never travels inside a content export.

## What does not work yet

Being direct about this, because the gaps are structural and you should not
discover them after typing in a portfolio:

- **Email is optional; without it there is no notification.**
  Enquiries always reach your inbox inside the admin. Configure SMTP (see
  [.env.example](.env.example)) and the owner is also emailed when one
  arrives, and a forgotten passphrase can be reset from `/admin/login` instead
  of deleting the owner record. Emailed one-time codes also work as a sign-in
  method.
- ~~Uploads unverified on the hosted stores.~~ **Both are now verified**, each
  end to end: upload through the admin, then an anonymous fetch of the result.
  Supabase cost two real bugs that would have broken every Supabase deployment
  after its first boot; Vercel Blob passed 48/48 first time.
- **Your home page starts as the theme's fixed layout.** Not a gap any more —
  building it from blocks under Pages starts from what it shows today, section
  by section, and takes over the moment you publish. Until you do, nothing
  about your site changes. The old layout is still edited on its own screen,
  which is the part that has not been merged away.
- **Six themes, but they are colour, type and spacing only.** Each one changes
  the palette, the typeface, how tight the layout is and how round the corners
  are — not the arrangement of the page. Blocks that show your records adapt to
  what you have, so a page is less fixed than it was, but a theme still cannot
  rearrange it.
- **The admin works on a phone, but was designed on a desktop.** It installs
  to a home screen, its navigation is a phone-sized menu, and every target was
  measured at 375px — but long editing screens are still easier on a wide one.
  New enquiries can buzz your devices: see
  [push notifications](docs/PUSH-NOTIFICATIONS.md).
- **Sign-in is an email and a passphrase — plus passkeys and emailed one-time codes.** Passkeys enroll in Settings; all three methods are offered on the sign-in page.
- **The newsletter collects addresses; it does not send.** Sign-up, double
  opt-in and export all work. Actually mailing your list means deliverability,
  bounce handling and list hygiene — a different product with different
  obligations — so the export is deliberately the exit: a CSV in the shape
  Buttondown, Mailchimp and the rest import. Sign-ups also need SMTP
  configured, because confirming means sending somebody a link.
- **One of the nine planned backends is not built.** Convex, which needs an
  account rather than an emulator and is therefore blocked on signup, not code.
  The eight that exist are the eight the README offers.

## Tech stack

- **[Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org)** (App Router) + **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for the public site, with colour and typography driven by CSS
  variables the editor writes at runtime
- **Pluggable storage** behind a `StorageAdapter` interface — local filesystem,
  Supabase, Neon + Vercel Blob, any Postgres, PocketBase, Firebase, Appwrite or
  Cloudflare D1 + R2
- **scrypt + httpOnly session cookies** for admin authentication
- **Vitest**, including a storage conformance suite run against a real Postgres
  in CI

### Documentation

Both sets are published at
**[getopenportfolio.vercel.app](https://getopenportfolio.vercel.app)** —
[help centre](https://getopenportfolio.vercel.app/help) and
[developer docs](https://getopenportfolio.vercel.app/docs).

They are written for two different people, and live in [site/](site/) — a
separate application in this repository that builds to a static export. It is
not part of what you deploy.

- **Help centre** (`site/content/help/`) — for anyone with a portfolio to run.
  Never shows a terminal command; where a task needs one it links across.
- **Developer docs** (`site/content/docs/`) — self-hosting, every environment
  variable, the storage adapter contract, the block system, the theme tokens,
  and why it is built the way it is.

Both are plain Markdown with four lines of frontmatter, and the navigation,
search and sitemap are generated from the files. `cd site && npm install &&
npm run dev` to read them locally.

What changed in each release, and who asked for it, is in
**[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**. Detailed status for every phase, including
what is verified and what is not, is in **[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)**. If you
are picking this project up to work on it, start with
**[docs/HANDOVER.md](docs/HANDOVER.md)**.

**Ask for something.** Open **Help & feedback** in your own admin: it checks
whether somebody already reported it — or whether it is already fixed in a
newer version — fills in your version and setup, and sends it under your own
GitHub account so you are credited when it lands.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — especially bug reports from actually using the admin,
accessibility fixes, and interface copy that stops assuming the user is a
designer.

Two rules worth reading before you start: **no personal or client content in the
repository** (demo content must be fictional, yours, or CC0), and **no secrets in
the client bundle**.

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — setup, conventions, DCO sign-off
- **[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)** — architecture, phase status, handoff notes
- **[ADMIN_SETUP.md](ADMIN_SETUP.md)** — using the editor
- **[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**
- **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** — report vulnerabilities privately, never as an issue

## Licence

[MIT](LICENSE). Use it, fork it, sell what you build with it.

Demo assets in `public/demo/` are CC0 and depict invented companies — see
[public/demo/LICENSE.md](public/demo/LICENSE.md).
