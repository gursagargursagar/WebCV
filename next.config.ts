/**
 * Security headers.
 *
 * Set here so they apply on every host, not only Vercel — a self-hoster behind
 * nginx gets the same defaults as someone clicking Deploy.
 *
 * CSP is a baseline, not a strict nonce policy: the root layout ships a
 * blocking inline theme script (no flash of the wrong theme) and Next.js App
 * Router emits its own inline flight scripts. A `script-src 'self'`-only policy
 * would break both. What this policy still buys: no plugins/objects, no
 * framing except same-origin (admin device preview needs it), restricted
 * frame targets for the video facade, the Turnstile challenge widget and the
 * embeds the blocks build — Cal.com and Calendly, and the social set
 * (Instagram, Behance, Substack). Every one of those hosts is allowlisted by
 * the block that frames it, and `core/blocks/__tests__/frame-src.test.ts`
 * keeps this list and those allowlists in step: the Turnstile widget once
 * shipped with a policy that refused its own iframe, and that is the shape of
 * bug a second list invites. Also `base-uri`/`form-action` locked to self. A
 * per-request nonce policy is the follow-up, not today's change.
