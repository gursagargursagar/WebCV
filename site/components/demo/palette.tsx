/**
 * Add a block.
 *
 * This used to be a list of names with a note saying adding was switched off
 * "so the demo stays the shape it started in" — which protected a demo nobody
 * asked to be protected, and withheld the one action that answers the question
 * the visitor came with. Building a page is the product. A visitor who cannot
 * add a block has not tried it.
 *
 * Grouped exactly as the product groups them, because `group` is a field on the
 * block definition and not a decision this file gets to make. What each button
 * inserts is `definition.defaults()` — the same call the real admin makes — so a
 * block added here arrives in the state the product would give it, warnings and
 * empty fields included. An added block that arrived pre-filled would be a lie
 * about the first thing you do after adding one.
