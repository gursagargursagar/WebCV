# Theming

## The layer

A theme is a set of CSS custom properties, rendered into a scoped `<style>` on the server. Not written to `documentElement` in an effect — doing that flashes the default palette on every load, which the first version of this project did.

Six ship: Editorial, Terminal, Gallery, Warm, Bold and Minimal. Each sets palette, typeface, spacing scale and corner radius together, in light and dark.

## What a theme owns

Colour, type, spacing, radius, hairline weight, motion durations. Everything a block reads through `var(--…)`.

## What a theme cannot do

**Rearrange a page.** A theme changes how things look, never where they are. Arrangement comes from which blocks the owner placed and in what order — which is why the blocks that place records matter more than a seventh theme would.

This is the honest limitation to state when somebody asks whether the designs are different enough. They are six looks, not six layouts.

## The override rule

The owner's own values sit on top of the theme, and the rule is one sentence: **a non-empty override wins; an empty one defers to the theme.**

So switching theme never discards a colour somebody chose deliberately, and clearing a field returns it to the theme rather than to white.

## Contrast: clamped first, gated second

The order matters and it is easy to describe backwards.

**`generateTokens` clamps.** Text, border and link roles are derived from the background actually given, and each is enforced to a readable ratio at generation. So most unreadable palettes never exist — even a neon accent yields usable subtle, link and border roles.

**`auditContrast` gates what survives.** Publishing runs it over the resolved palette and **refuses** a combination nobody could read. Enforced at the endpoint rather than only in the dashboard, because a client that skips the warning — or a direct call — must not be able to put unreadable text in front of visitors.

The practical consequence, which the marketing site's demo made obvious: you cannot easily provoke the refusal by picking a bad accent, because clamping gets there first. Do not write copy promising that you can.

Scoped to contrast on purpose. The health report marks other things "blocking" that are judgement calls; refusing every one of them would make publishing feel broken rather than careful.

## Adding a theme

A token file, and that is the whole of it. If a theme needs a block to change its markup, the contract has been broken and the fix is in the block or the primitive, not in the theme.

The first theme, `editorial`, carries the exact values the site had before themes existed, so upgrading restyles nobody's site.
