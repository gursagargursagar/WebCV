/**
 * The marketing and documentation site.
 *
 * A separate application from the product in the repository root, and not an
 * npm workspace member, so `npm install` for somebody deploying their own
 * portfolio never touches any of this. Deployed as its own Vercel project with
 * the root directory set to `site`.
 *
 * The reason it cannot live in the product's `app/` directory: the Deploy
 * button clones this entire repository into the user's own GitHub account, so
 * anything under `app/` becomes a route on **their** portfolio. Nobody's
 * personal site should serve `/alternatives/squarespace`.

   * Two roots, and they are deliberately different.
   *
   * `turbopack.root` stays at `site/`. Move it up and Next decides the
   * repository root is the workspace root and compiles the *product's*
   * `proxy.ts`, which fails naming a file this application has never
   * heard of.
   *
   * `outputFileTracingRoot` is the repository root, and that is what lets the
   * demo import the product's real theme presets, primitives and block
   * definitions from `../core`. With it left at `site/`, every relative import
   * that climbs out of this directory resolves to nothing — the file is plainly
   * there on disk and the bundler will not look at it.
   *
   * Note what is *not* here: an alias pointing `react` and `zod` at this
   * application's copies. `core/**` resolves its bare imports from the
   * repository root's `node_modules`, exactly as it does on a developer's
   * machine, and the Vercel project's install command — `cd .. && npm ci && cd
   * site && npm ci` — installs both trees so that it can, dev dependencies
   * included, because `core/primitives` needs `@types/react` to type-check and
   * types are dev dependencies. Aliasing was tried first and Turbopack rejects
   * an absolute path in `resolveAlias` without saying so usefully.
