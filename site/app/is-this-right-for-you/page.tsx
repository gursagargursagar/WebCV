/**
 * The page that tells some readers to leave.
 *
 * Borrowed wholesale from the one project in the research whose credibility
 * came from doing exactly this. It works for a reason that is not really about
 * honesty as a virtue: a reader who has already decided you will oversell will
 * discount everything else on the site, and the only way to interrupt that is
 * to say the disqualifying thing before they find it.
 *
 * The rule for this page: **no sentence may end with a clause that takes back
 * the sentence.** "It is alpha, but…" is worth nothing.

                It is in your database. You can export all of it at any moment as one JSON file. An
                older build quarantines content it does not recognise rather than dropping it, so a
                rollback cannot destroy what a newer version wrote. Concurrent edits are detected
                rather than silently overwriting each other, and the last twenty published snapshots
                can each be restored.

                something is, it may be somewhere else in three months. That is the actual cost of
                using this now, and it is an irritation rather than a loss.

                site keeps running, your content is exportable, and the licence on what has already
                been released cannot be withdrawn.
