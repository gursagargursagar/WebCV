 * The demo page.
 *
 * "Demo" is a captured word — six of twenty-four projects in the research use
 * it to mean "talk to a salesperson", and one vendor's `/demo` literally
 * redirects to a sales page. So this page says what it is in the first line and
 * the button says **Open the editor**, not "Request a demo".
 *
 * At zero users the demo *is* the proof, which is why it takes the primary
 * call-to-action slot on the homepage rather than sitting below the fold.

              The browser demo simulates sign-in, saving, uploads and email. If you want those
              working — a real database, a real inbox, a real publish — the product ships a demo
              mode of its own, and it is one command.

              That mode is part of the product rather than a sandbox somebody maintains, which is
              the only version of this that stays alive. Every hand-maintained demo instance in the
              research was dead or retired.

                All twenty-seven, grouped as your own install groups them. Each arrives empty, which
                is what adding a block actually looks like — including the warning telling you it

                you expect — and a publish-time check catches what clamping cannot.

              <strong>Real, and imported from the product:</strong> every block and the renderer
              that draws them, the theme token generator, the profession vocabulary that renames
              your sections, the editor&rsquo;s forms — which are generated from each block&rsquo;s
              own field metadata — and the content warnings, including the one telling you a block
