              <strong>Nothing about another product appears without a source and a date.</strong>{' '}
              Pricing changes, features are added and support articles are rewritten. A comparison
              page with no dates on it is describing a product as it was on some unknown day, and
              most of them are describing one that no longer exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Where we could not verify something, it says so.</strong> Netlify&rsquo;s
              credit model is on the cost page marked unverified, because what one credit buys is
              not published and the documentation URL for it returns a 404. Wix&rsquo;s prices come
              from two named third parties, because their own page is rendered in JavaScript and
              could not be read. Neither is rounded up into a fact.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Every page names at least two things the other product does better</strong>,
              specifically, with no hedging clause afterwards. If two could not be found honestly,
              the page would not exist. You have used these products; a page that pretends they have
              no advantages is telling you it was not written for somebody who knows anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>No logos and no screenshots of anybody else&rsquo;s product.</strong> Naming a
              product in text to describe what it does is ordinary and fair; reproducing a mark is a
              different thing and buys nothing.
