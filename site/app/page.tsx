 * vocabularies never meet — someone who wants a portfolio and does not want to
 * think about a database, and someone who will only take it seriously if it
 * self-hosts. The research settled how: the outcome goes in the headline, and
 * "open source" and "self-hosted" go in the line directly beneath it. Twelve of
 * twenty-four sub-headlines in the surveyed corpus carry those words; only
 * three of twenty-four headlines do.
 *
 * Every feature claim here was checked against the shipped product on the date
 * in `CHECKED_ON`, not against the plan. Where the plan and the product
 * disagree, the product wins and the sentence gets rewritten.

        No paid tier, no account, nothing gated, and no plan to add any. The catch is that you host
        it, and hosting a thing is a real job — small, but real. The{' '}
        <a href="/what-it-costs">cost page</a> is the honest version.

    q: 'What happens to my site if you stop working on this?',
    a: (
      <p>
        Nothing. It is running on your infrastructure, from a version you already have, under a
        licence that cannot be withdrawn from anything already released. You can fork it. That is
        the whole point of the arrangement and it is not a promise — it is what the licence already
        does.

    q: 'Will you go closed source later?',
    a: (
      <p>
        Everything released so far is MIT and stays MIT — a licence cannot be revoked from a version
        already published. What nobody can honestly promise is what a future version is licensed
        under, and any project telling you otherwise is telling you something it cannot enforce.
        What protects you is that you can keep and fork the version you have.
      </p>
    ),

    q: 'Do I need to know how to code?',

      <p>
        No, to use it. Two of the three install paths are a button and one command; the third is for
        people who want to run it from source. After that everything is the admin, and there is a
        separate <a href="/help">help centre</a> that never shows you a terminal.

    q: 'Can I move my existing Squarespace or Wix site over?',

        Not automatically, and be careful of anyone who says otherwise — Wix has no export at all
        and Squarespace&rsquo;s omits exactly the portfolio and gallery pages you would want. In
        practice you copy your text and re-upload your images. For a portfolio that is an evening,
        not a project.

      <p>
        It is alpha, and <a href="/is-this-right-for-you">this page</a> says precisely what that
        means and who should wait. The short version: your content is safe — it is in your database,
        exportable at any moment, and an older build quarantines content it does not understand
        rather than dropping it. What is not settled is the admin.
      </p>

    q: 'What does it look like? Can I change the design?',
    a: (
      <p>
        Six themes, each changing palette, typeface, spacing and radius together in light and dark,
        and you can override any part of one. What a theme cannot yet do is rearrange the page —
        that comes from which blocks you place. The <a href="/demo">demo</a> is the fastest answer.

    ),

  {
    q: 'Can I sell websites built with this?',

      <p>
        Yes. MIT — use it, fork it, charge for what you build with it. One caution: if you deploy
        client sites on Vercel&rsquo;s Hobby plan, read their non-commercial clause first. It is
        quoted in full on the <a href="/what-it-costs">cost page</a>.
