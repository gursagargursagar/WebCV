/**
 * Every claim this site makes about somebody else, with its source and the date
 * it was checked.
 *
 * The rule, and it has no exceptions: **a competitor fact does not appear on
 * this site unless it appears in this file with a URL and a date.** Marketing
 * pages routinely state a rival's pricing or limitations with no citation and
 * no date, which is how they end up describing a product that changed a year
 * ago. Ours states both, visibly, next to the claim.
 *
 * `status` is not decoration either:
 *
 * - `verified` — read on the vendor's own page on the date given.
 * - `third-party` — the vendor's page could not be read (JavaScript-rendered,
 *   region-locked, erroring) and this comes from a named third party instead.
 * - `unverified` — we could not establish it. It is published **as** unverified
 *   or not at all, and never rounded up into a fact.
 *
 * Rechecking is a real chore and the dates are what make it possible to know
 * what is stale. That is the trade.
