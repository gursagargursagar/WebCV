# Open Portfolio, as a container.
#
# Why this exists: without it, "self-hosted" means "hosted on Vercel", which is
# not the same thing and is not what the licence promises. This image runs the
# same commit on a VPS, a home server or a Raspberry Pi, with no account
# anywhere and no platform to be turned off by.
#
# Build:  docker build -t open-portfolio .
# Run:    docker run -p 3000:3000 -v opb-data:/data open-portfolio
#
# For a complete setup with a database, use `docker compose up` instead.
